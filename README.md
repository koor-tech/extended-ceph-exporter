# extended-ceph-exporter

A Prometheus exporter to provide "extended" metrics about a Ceph cluster's running components (e.g., RGW).

[![Ceph - RGW Bucket Usage Overview Grafana Dashboard Screenshot](grafana/ceph-rgw-bucket-usage-overview.png)](grafana/)

## Requirements

* Needs a Ceph cluster up and running.

* Needs an admin user

    ```
    radosgw-admin user create --uid extended-ceph-exporter --display-name "extended-ceph-exporter admin user" --caps "buckets=read;users=read;usage=read;metadata=read;zone=read"
    # Access key / "Username"
    radosgw-admin user info --uid extended-ceph-exporter | jq '.keys[0].access_key'
    # Secret key / "Password
    radosgw-admin user info --uid extended-ceph-exporter | jq '.keys[0].secret_key'
    ```

## Quickstart

* Clone the repository:
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/koor-tech/extended-ceph-exporter
  cd extended-ceph-exporter
  ```

* Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. Configure your RGW credentials and endpoint in the `.env` file.

* Configure Prometheus to collect metrics from the exporter from `:9138/metrics` endpoint using a static configuration, here's a sample scrape job from the `prometheus.yml`:

  ```yaml
  # For more information on Prometheus scrape_configs:
  # https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config
  scrape_configs:

    - job_name: "extended-ceph-metrics"

      # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 30 seconds.
      scrape_interval: 30s

      static_configs:
        # Please change the ip address `127.0.0.1` to target the exporter is running
        - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9138']
  ```

* To run the exporter locally, run `go run .`

* Should you have Grafana running for metrics visulization, check out the [Grafana dashboards](grafana/).

### Helm

To install the exporter to Kubernetes using Helm, check out the [extended-ceph-exporter Helm Chart](charts/extended-ceph-exporter/).

## Collectors

There is varying support for collectors. The tables
below list all existing collectors and the required Ceph components.

### Enabled by default

| Name             |                            Description                            | Ceph Component |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------: | -------------- |
| `rgw_buckets`    | Exposes RGW Bucket Usage and Quota metrics from the Ceph cluster. | RGW            |
| `rgw_user_quota` |       Exposes RGW User Quota metrics from the Ceph cluster.       | RGW            |

## Development

### Requirements

* Golang 1.19
* Depending on the module requirements, a Ceph cluster with the respective Ceph components.

### Making Changes to the Helm Chart

When changing anything in the Helm Chart, the version in the `Chart.yaml` needs to be increased according to [Semver](https://semver.org/).
Additionally `make helm-doc` must be run afterwards and the changes to the Helm Chart's `README.md` must be commited as well.

### Debugging

A VSCode debug config is available to run and debug the project.

To make the exporter talk with a Ceph RGW S3 endpoint, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
Be sure ot add your Ceph RGW S3 endpoint and credentials in it.
